This is a poorly and fastly written (in 2 hours) web app to aggregate all the official informational website that is out there showing COVID-19 data
Not everyone has bookmarked all the links and there is not really a place to see for all the data
This is a open source project with a lot of scope of improvements.
I will be happy to recieve PRs

Tech Stack : React
Request.js has a sample axios request

Feel free to contribute to the codebase.
